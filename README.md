## Dev TODO:

Components:

- **navbar**:
    - [x] add dropdown for posts (no, there will be way too many files)
    - [ ] add sub directories for topics (this one can be a drop down)
    - [x] home folder should be red (or maybe pink)
    - [ ] topics link should take to a list of topics
    - [ ] about-me.md and all "files" should be blue
    - [x] hover "animation" should be similar to file picker (background color)
    - [ ] make navbar take up rest of vertical space
    - [ ] highlight current place (prob pass a parameter to the partial when
      calling it)

- **main content**:
    - [x] should be a little wider, maybe instead of 80% do 90-95% of viewport
      (decided to do 95%)
    - [x] space between content and outer border should be a bit thinner
    - [x] links should open in a new tab

- **list view**:
    - [x] do a "back" (./..) button since user might have navigated from
      somewhere else to get to that list of blogs
    - [x] check if pagination is easy (yes it was)
    - [x] check how easy it would be to make a preview on hover summary (i am
      thinking of just doing css and using `display:none`) no preview i dont
      think it will be useful, cool idea but not too useful yet.

- **single page**:
    - [x] add next and prev buttons to cycle through blogs

- **about-me**:
    - [x] write about me ig
    - [x] this might be too overlapping with the home page
    - [x] move "Why this site?" from the home page to here

- **home page**:
    - [x] either port over old home page or make a new home page
    - [x] decide if I will be putting a pic of me or not (no)
    - [x] make logo point back to the home page
    - [x] should this have the most recent blog? nah just a link to the posts
      page
    - [x] make content-view have a max-width (prob in pixels since 80% will be
      too much on wide screens)

- **misc files**:
    - [x] add resume file to navbar
    - [x] add "symlink" for email
    - [x] add "symlink" for github
    - [x] decide if I want to add any other socials (nah i dont have anything
      else worth sharing yet)
    
- **footer**:
    - [ ] should I add a footer?

- **css**:
    - [ ] use a range for adding css files to the head of the html
    - [ ] make sure that the names of the files are okay and understandable for
      the future
    - [ ] global header styling (cool if headers could keep the #)
    - [ ] global link styling (if it is a link to another part of the website
      then that one can just replace the tab if not then target _blank)
