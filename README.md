## Dev TODO:

Components:

- **navbar**:
    - [ ] add dropdown for posts 
    - [ ] add dub directories for topics
    - [ ] home folder should be red (or maybe pink)
    - [ ] topics link should take to a list of topics
    - [ ] about-me.md and all "files" should be blue
    - [ ] hover "animation" should be similar to file picker (background color)
    - [ ] make navbar take up rest of vertical space

- **main content**:
    - [ ] should be a little wider, maybe instead of 80% do 90-95% of viewport
    - [ ] space between content and outer border should be a bit thinner

- **list view**:
    - [ ] do a "back" (./..) button since user might have navigated from
      somewhere else to get to that list of blogs
    - [ ] check if pagination is easy
    - [ ] check how easy it would be to make a preview on hover summary (i am
      thinking of just doing css and using `display:none`)

- **single page**:
    - [ ] add next and prev buttons to cycle through blogs
    - [ ] add breadcrumbs for 

- **about-me**:
    - [ ] write about me ig
    - [ ] this might be too overlapping with the home page

- **home page**:
    - [ ] either port over old home page or make a new home page
    - [ ] decide if I will be putting a pic of me or not
    - [ ] make logo point back to the home page
    - [ ] should this have the most recent blog?

- **misc files**:
    - [ ] add resume file to navbar
    - [ ] add "symlink" for email
    - [ ] add "symlink" for github
    - [ ] decide if I want to add any other socials
    
- **footer**:
    - [ ] should I add a footer?

- **css**:
    - [ ] use a range for adding css files to the head of the html
    - [ ] make sure that the names of the files are okay and understandable for
      the future
