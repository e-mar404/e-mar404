# Why I'm Learning Elixir

Why im writing about this:

- it feels weird to be a jr dev that does not yet have a job in the software
  developer industry (Sys admin) and learning elixir, makes me feel im making my
  self not "job marketable"

- stuck in a loop of "looking at job reqs" -> "i should learn the technologies
  they prefer" -> "i divide my attention too thin and not learn anything" -> 
  "I get burnout and stop coding for a while" -> "get worried about jobs" -> 
  start all over again

- this is what i find fun, ever since learning about erlang i found fp very
  fascinating

- during uni one of my classes introduced us to a large amount of programming
  languages and realized there is more than just learning the in demand stuff

- since i already have a job, im in the privileged position to be able to
  experience and learn new stuff that is not necessarily something people are
  hiring for right now (in order to bring the joy of programming back)
