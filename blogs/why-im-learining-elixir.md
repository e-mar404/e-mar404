# Elixir as a Hobby & Go as a Career

As any new CS grad knows, the job market has been pretty rough. This has made
me obsesively look at job postings an see the dreaded "2+ years of in the job 
experience" for an entry level job and not know where to get started breaking
through and getting that first job.

During my last semester in uni my programming languages professor (Dr. Venkat
Subramaniam) ... (talk about how i found joy in the simplistic and fp,
specifically mention the dsl assignment and each assignment having 2-3 different
programming languages)

- this is what i find fun, ever since learning about erlang i found fp very
  fascinating

- during uni one of my classes introduced us to a large amount of programming
  languages and realized there is more than just learning the in demand stuff

- since i already have a job, im in the privileged position to be able to
  experience and learn new stuff that is not necessarily something people are
  hiring for right now (in order to bring the joy of programming back)
