# Elixir as a Hobby & Go as a Career

This is just a quick jot down of an observation I had recently, this is not a
full on discovery of my thoughts.

During my last semester I took a non-conventional programming languages course 
with [Dr. Venkat Subramaniam](https://x.com/venkat_s?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).
This course was unconventional because usually the course covers how programming
languages are made (lexical parsers, compilers, type systems, etc.), but this one
was trying to get as much exposure to as many programming languages we could.
The entire course focused on immutability/functional programming and was my 
first introduction to functional programming. Each assignment needed to use 2-3 
different languages and there is usually a constraint on each one like 
strong/weak typing, static/dynamic, etc. This is where I first used Erlang and 
found it so different to what I have used in the past that I became very curious
about it and that's when I found Elixir (Brazil mentioned!). 

I started reading [Elixir in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action-third-edition) and
learning more and more about Elixir to where I have started to look at making a
multiplayer game with Elixir as the server for it. I could see myself trying to
make Elixir the language I focus on for a career for the next few years, but as
any new CS grad knows, the job market has been pretty rough. Not only junior /
new grad jobs are hard enough to get entry level Elixir jobs are even rarer.
This has been partly discouraging, making me feel forced to learn something more
widely available for jobs but that still provides me with joy and feel curious
to learn. That is when I stumbled upon Go.

Go an exemplary simple language which is great for the backend and networking is
very attractive to me since I do want to break into the backend. And looking at
the available jobs for golang jobs vs elixir I'm coming to the painful
realization that functional programming jobs might exist, but they are most
likely not advertised and will have to wait for something either through
internal moving or doing my own thing/oss.
