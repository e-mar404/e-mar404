# Hello! My name is Emilio Marin

I’m a System Administrator at [Beta Academy](https://www.betaacademy.org) and a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Houston.

I love learning new technologies and developer tools, especially when related to
Neovim, Go, productivity systems, and command line tooling. I enjoy 
understanding *how things work*, even when that means being confused for a 
while.

Read more [about me](/about-me) and the tech I use as well as my [posts](/posts)!

## Contact

All the socials I actively check are linked on the left as symlinks. I’m always 
open to conversation so feel free to reach out.
