# Hello! My name is Emilio Marin

I’m a System Administrator at [Beta Academy](https://www.betaacademy.org) and a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Houston.

I love learning new technologies and developer tools, especially when related to
Neovim, Go, productivity systems, and command line tooling. I enjoy 
understanding *how things work*, even when that means being confused for a 
while.

Read more [about me](/about-me) and the tech I use as well as my [posts](/posts)!

## Why This Site?

Early in my career, I fell into a trap I see a lot of junior developers hit: 
pretending to understand things I didn't. Not sure if it was ego, fear of 
looking inexperienced/asking “dumb” questions or just being plain wrong.

That fear kept me from learning as openly and effectively as I could have. Ended
up being afraid to fail publicly *and* privately, so I did not give myself room
to grow and get a hold of all the opportunities that I could have early on.

This site is me choosing differently.

Here, I’ll write openly about my projects, mistakes, experiments, and ideas as I
work through them. Some posts will be rough. Some conclusions will be wrong but 
that's part of the process, and the point.

The name of this site and what I am going to make my online "persona" is an 
acceptance of what I used to avoid being ... a **Publicly Bad Dev**.

## Contact

All the socials I actively check are linked on the left as symlinks. I’m always 
open to conversation so feel free to reach out.
