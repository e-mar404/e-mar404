## Tools & OSS  

Most of the tools that I use are command line applications or FOSS. I want to
start contributing to OSS since I want to give back to the community in some
way. I do want to make sure that wtv I do contribute to is something I am
familiar with and do not use AI since there have been a few [OSS projects that
have not been accepting community
contributions](https://www.runtime.news/ai-slop-is-overwhelming-open-source/) due to so much AI slop. I know I
say that I trying to not be influenced by me being bad but that's where I draw
the line lol.

### OS

Ok time to be insufferable. I use NixOS btw... I say this since I am already 
running into a few issues where some pkgs are not fully updated so I might be 
that annoying person submitting prs to update their flakes...

I am planning a blog of me learning how to package stuff using nix flakes. In
particular I am doing this to package either zen or beeper.

## Why This Site?

Early in my career, I fell into a trap I see a lot of junior developers hit: 
pretending to understand things I didn't. Not sure if it was ego, fear of 
looking inexperienced/asking “dumb” questions or just being plain wrong.

That fear kept me from learning as openly and effectively as I could have. Ended
up being afraid to fail publicly *and* privately, so I did not give myself room
to grow and get a hold of all the opportunities that I could have early on.

This site is me choosing differently.

Here, I’ll write openly about my projects, mistakes, experiments, and ideas as I
work through them. Some posts will be rough. Some conclusions will be wrong but 
that's part of the process, and the point.

The name of this site and what I am going to make my online "persona" is an 
acceptance of what I used to avoid being ... a **Publicly Bad Dev**.
